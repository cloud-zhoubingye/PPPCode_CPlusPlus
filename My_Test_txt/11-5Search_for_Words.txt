The US has shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon that had been flying over its airspace.

Television footage showed a small explosion, followed by the balloon descending toward the water off the Carolina coast.

The balloon was shot down with a missile fired by an F-22 fighter aircraft, about six nautical miles off the coast near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, Pentagon officials said.

Ships were deployed in the water to mount the recovery operation.
US President Joe Biden said he wanted the balloon brought down on Wednesday but was advised that the best time for the operation would be when it was over water.

"They successfully took it down and I want to complement our aviators who did it," Mr Biden said.

A US defence official said the aircraft was a spy balloon and that China intended to use it on sensitive military sites.
