A.1.1. A message from one person to another with simple addressing

   This could be called a canonical message.  It has a single author,
   John Doe, a single recipient, Mary Smith, a subject, the date, a
   message identifier, and a textual message in the body.

----
From: John Doe <jdoe@machine.example>
To: Mary Smith <mary@example.net>
Subject: Saying Hello
Date: Fri, 21 Nov 1997 09:55:06 -0600
Message-ID: <1234@local.machine.example>

This is a message just to say hello.
So, "Hello".
----

   If John's secretary Michael actually sent the message, though John
   was the author and replies to this message should go back to him, the
   sender field would be used:

----
From: John Doe <jdoe@machine.example>
Sender: Michael Jones <mjones@machine.example>
To: Mary Smith <mary@example.net>
Subject: Saying Hello
Date: Fri, 21 Nov 1997 09:55:06 -0600
Message-ID: <1234@local.machine.example>

This is a message just to say hello.
So, "Hello".
----

A.1.2. Different types of mailboxes

   This message includes multiple addresses in the destination fields
   and also uses several different forms of addresses.

----
From: "Joe Q. Public" <john.q.public@example.com>
To: Mary Smith <mary@x.test>, jdoe@example.org, Who? <one@y.test>
Cc: <boss@nil.test>, "Giant; \"Big\" Box" <sysservices@example.net>
Date: Tue, 1 Jul 2003 10:52:37 +0200
Message-ID: <5678.21-Nov-1997@example.com>

Hi everyone.
----

   Note that the display names for Joe Q. Public and Giant; "Big" Box
   needed to be enclosed in double-quotes because the former contains
   the period and the latter contains both semicolon and double-quote
   characters (the double-quote characters appearing as quoted-pair
   construct).  Conversely, the display name for Who? could appear
   without them because the question mark is legal in an atom.  Notice
   also that jdoe@example.org and boss@nil.test have no display names
   associated with them at all, and jdoe@example.org uses the simpler
   address form without the angle brackets.

A.1.3. Group addresses

----
From: Pete <pete@silly.example>
To: A Group:Chris Jones <c@a.test>,joe@where.test,John <jdoe@one.test>;
Cc: Undisclosed recipients:;
Date: Thu, 13 Feb 1969 23:32:54 -0330
Message-ID: <testabcd.1234@silly.example>

Testing.
----

   In this message, the "To:" field has a single group recipient named A
   Group which contains 3 addresses, and a "Cc:" field with an empty
   group recipient named Undisclosed recipients.

A.2. Reply messages

   The following is a series of three messages that make up a
   conversation thread between John and Mary.  John firsts sends a
   message to Mary, Mary then replies to John's message, and then John
   replies to Mary's reply message.

   Note especially the "Message-ID:", "References:", and "In-Reply-To:"
   fields in each message.

----
From: John Doe <jdoe@machine.example>
To: Mary Smith <mary@example.net>
Subject: Saying Hello
Date: Fri, 21 Nov 1997 09:55:06 -0600
Message-ID: <1234@local.machine.example>

This is a message just to say hello.
So, "Hello".
----

   When sending replies, the Subject field is often retained, though
   prepended with "Re: " as described in section 3.6.5.

----
From: Mary Smith <mary@example.net>
To: John Doe <jdoe@machine.example>
Reply-To: "Mary Smith: Personal Account" <smith@home.example>
Subject: Re: Saying Hello
Date: Fri, 21 Nov 1997 10:01:10 -0600
Message-ID: <3456@example.net>
In-Reply-To: <1234@local.machine.example>
References: <1234@local.machine.example>

This is a reply to your hello.
----

   Note the "Reply-To:" field in the above message.  When John replies
   to Mary's message above, the reply should go to the address in the
   "Reply-To:" field instead of the address in the "From:" field.

----
To: "Mary Smith: Personal Account" <smith@home.example>
From: John Doe <jdoe@machine.example>
Subject: Re: Saying Hello
Date: Fri, 21 Nov 1997 11:00:00 -0600 TX77845
Message-ID: <abcd.1234@local.machine.tld>
In-Reply-To: <3456@example.net>
References: <1234@local.machine.example> <3456@example.net>

This is a reply to your reply.
----

A.3. Resent messages

   Start with the message that has been used as an example several
   times:

----
From: John Doe <jdoe@machine.example>
To: Mary Smith <mary@example.net>
Subject: Saying Hello
Date: Fri, 21 Nov 1997 09:55:06 -0600
Message-ID: <1234@local.machine.example>

This is a message just to say hello.
So, "Hello".
----

   Say that Mary, upon receiving this message, wishes to send a copy of
   the message to Jane such that (a) the message would appear to have
   come straight from John; (b) if Jane replies to the message, the
   reply should go back to John; and (c) all of the original
   information, like the date the message was originally sent to Mary,
   the message identifier, and the original addressee, is preserved.  In
   this case, resent fields are prepended to the message:

----
Resent-From: Mary Smith <mary@example.net>
Resent-To: Jane Brown <j-brown@other.example>
Resent-Date: Mon, 24 Nov 1997 14:22:01 -0800
Resent-Message-ID: <78910@example.net>
From: John Doe <jdoe@machine.example>
To: Mary Smith <mary@example.net>
Subject: Saying Hello
Date: Fri, 21 Nov 1997 09:55:06 -0600
Message-ID: <1234@local.machine.example>

This is a message just to say hello.
So, "Hello".
----

   If Jane, in turn, wished to resend this message to another person,
   she would prepend her own set of resent header fields to the above
   and send that.

A.4. Messages with trace fields

   As messages are sent through the transport system as described in
   [RFC2821], trace fields are prepended to the message.  The following
   is an example of what those trace fields might look like.  Note that
   there is some folding white space in the first one since these lines
   can be long.

----
Received: from x.y.test
   by example.net
   via TCP
   with ESMTP
   id ABC12345
   for <mary@example.net>;  21 Nov 1997 10:05:43 -0600
Received: from machine.example by x.y.test; 21 Nov 1997 10:01:22 -0600
From: John Doe <jdoe@machine.example>
To: Mary Smith <mary@example.net>
Subject: Saying Hello
Date: Fri, 21 Nov 1997 09:55:06 -0600
Message-ID: <1234@local.machine.example>

This is a message just to say hello.
So, "Hello".
----

A.5. White space, comments, and other oddities

   White space, including folding white space, and comments can be
   inserted between many of the tokens of fields.  Taking the example
   from A.1.3, white space and comments can be inserted into all of the
   fields.

----
From: Pete(A wonderful \) chap) <pete(his account)@silly.test(his host)>
To:A Group(Some people)
     :Chris Jones <c@(Chris's host.)public.example>,
         joe@example.org,
  John <jdoe@one.test> (my dear friend); (the end of the group)
Cc:(Empty list)(start)Undisclosed recipients  :(nobody(that I know))  ;
Date: Thu,
      13
        Feb
          1969
      23:32
               -0330 (Newfoundland Time)
Message-ID:              <testabcd.1234@silly.test>

Testing.
----

   The above example is aesthetically displeasing, but perfectly legal.
   Note particularly (1) the comments in the "From:" field (including
   one that has a ")" character appearing as part of a quoted-pair); (2)
   the white space absent after the ":" in the "To:" field as well as
   the comment and folding white space after the group name, the special
   character (".") in the comment in Chris Jones's address, and the
   folding white space before and after "joe@example.org,"; (3) the
   multiple and nested comments in the "Cc:" field as well as the
   comment immediately following the ":" after "Cc"; (4) the folding
   white space (but no comments except at the end) and the missing
   seconds in the time of the date field; and (5) the white space before
   (but not within) the identifier in the "Message-ID:" field.

A.6. Obsoleted forms

   The following are examples of obsolete (that is, the "MUST NOT
   generate") syntactic elements described in section 4 of this
   document.

A.6.1. Obsolete addressing

   Note in the below example the lack of quotes around Joe Q. Public,
   the route that appears in the address for Mary Smith, the two commas
   that appear in the "To:" field, and the spaces that appear around the
   "." in the jdoe address.

----
From: Joe Q. Public <john.q.public@example.com>
To: Mary Smith <@machine.tld:mary@example.net>, , jdoe@test   . example
Date: Tue, 1 Jul 2003 10:52:37 +0200 TX 77646
Message-ID: <5678.21-Nov-1997@example.com>

Hi everyone.
----

A.6.2. Obsolete dates

   The following message uses an obsolete date format, including a non-
   numeric time zone and a two digit year.  Note that although the
   day-of-week is missing, that is not specific to the obsolete syntax;
   it is optional in the current syntax as well.

----
From: John Doe <jdoe@machine.example>
To: Mary Smith <mary@example.net>
Subject: Saying Hello
Date: 21 Nov 97 09:55:06 GMT
Message-ID: <1234@local.machine.example>

This is a message just to say hello.
So, "Hello".
----

A.6.3. Obsolete white space and comments

   White space and comments can appear between many more elements than
   in the current syntax.  Also, folding lines that are made up entirely
   of white space are legal.

----
From  : John Doe <jdoe@machine(comment).  example>
To    : Mary Smith
__
          <mary@example.net>
Subject     : Saying Hello
Date  : Fri, 21 Nov 1997 09(comment):   55  :  06 -0600 TT   77001-4544
Message-ID  : <1234   @   local(blah)  .machine .example>

This is a message just to say hello.
So, "Hello".
